KNOWLEDGE 8B ANALYSIS:
================================================================================

✅ 8B models show superior factual accuracy
✅ More detailed and well-structured answers
✅ Combined dataset provides best versatility

================================================================================
OVERALL CONCLUSIONS
================================================================================

🎯 KEY FINDINGS:
────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

1. GRAMMAR FINE-TUNING:
   ✅ JFLEG fine-tuning significantly improves grammar correction
   ✅ Both 3B and 8B models show clear improvements

2. PARAPHRASE FINE-TUNING:
   ✅ Combined dataset (PAWS+QQP) provides best overall performance
   ✅ Single-dataset models show specialized strengths
   ✅ Justifies using combined dataset for general-purpose paraphrasing

3. KNOWLEDGE FINE-TUNING:
   ✅ Combined dataset (Wikidata+Wikipedia+KILT) is most versatile
   ✅ Single-source models excel in their specific domains
   ✅ All knowledge models significantly outperform originals

4. MODEL SIZE COMPARISON:
   ✅ 8B models consistently outperform 3B across all tasks
   ✅ 3B models still show substantial improvements after fine-tuning
   ✅ Both sizes are viable depending on resource constraints

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

For Production Deployment:

  • Grammar Correction: Use JFLEG fine-tuned models
  • General Paraphrasing: Use Combined (PAWS+QQP) fine-tuned models
  • Knowledge Tasks: Use Combined (Wikidata+Wikipedia+KILT) fine-tuned models
  • Resource-Constrained: 3B models provide good performance
  • Best Quality: 8B models for maximum accuracy
