## Important Discovery: System Prompts for Knowledge Tasks

‚ö†Ô∏è **Key Finding**: Knowledge/description generation tasks require **system prompts** for optimal performance.

During evaluation, we discovered that:
- ‚úÖ **Grammar and Paraphrase** models performed excellently without system prompts
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Knowledge models** were generating conversational responses instead of informative descriptions
- ‚úÖ **Solution**: Added system prompt to guide models toward factual, informative outputs

**System Prompt Used**:
```
"You are a knowledgeable assistant. Provide informative, factual descriptions 
and explanations to answer questions. Focus on delivering comprehensive 
information rather than just conversational responses."
```

**Result**: All knowledge models were re-evaluated with system prompts for accurate assessment.
