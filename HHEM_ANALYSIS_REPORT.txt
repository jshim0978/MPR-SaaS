================================================================================
CONCLUSIONS
================================================================================

✅ FACTUAL ACCURACY: All models perform well (~95-100%)
   • No significant hallucination issues detected
   • All models provide correct factual information

📊 STYLE DIFFERENCE: Combined vs Original
   • Original models: Detailed, explanatory, contextual
   • Combined models: Brief, concise, direct answers

🎯 INTERPRETATION:
   The Wikipedia + Wikidata training did NOT reduce factual accuracy.
   Instead, it changed the STYLE from detailed to concise.

   Both approaches are factually correct, the difference is:
   • Original: 'Teaching' style (explanations, context, examples)
   • Combined: 'Reference' style (direct facts, no elaboration)

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATION
================================================================================

For your use case (informative, detailed descriptions):

✅ USE: Original models (3B or 8B)
   • Already factually accurate
   • Naturally provide detailed, informative responses
   • Better for educational/explanatory content

❌ AVOID: Combined (Wiki + Wikidata) models
   • Too concise for your needs
   • Lack the detail and context you want
   • Better suited for quick fact lookups, not explanations

💡 NEXT STEP:
   Optimize system prompts for the original models to guide
   them toward your preferred level of detail and structure.
