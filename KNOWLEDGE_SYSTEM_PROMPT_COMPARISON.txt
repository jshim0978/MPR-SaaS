EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
================================================================================

✅ Re-evaluated all 10 knowledge models with improved system prompts
✅ System prompt guides models to provide informative descriptions
✅ Comparison shows impact of prompt engineering on model outputs

System Prompt Used:
  "You are a knowledgeable assistant. Provide informative, factual
   descriptions and explanations to answer questions. Focus on delivering
   comprehensive information rather than just conversational responses."

ANALYSIS
================================================================================

🎯 KEY OBSERVATIONS:

1. PROMPT ENGINEERING IMPACT:
   • System prompts provide clear guidance for response style
   • Models adapt their output based on the system instructions
   • Both original and fine-tuned models respond to system prompts

2. RESPONSE CHARACTERISTICS:
   • WITH system prompt: More focused on answering the question
   • WITHOUT system prompt: More varied response styles
   • System prompt ensures consistency across all models

3. FINE-TUNING EFFECTIVENESS:
   • Fine-tuned models still show knowledge improvements
   • Combined datasets provide broader knowledge coverage
   • Single-source models excel in their specific domains

================================================================================
CONCLUSIONS
================================================================================

✅ SYSTEM PROMPTS are essential for knowledge/description tasks
✅ FINE-TUNING remains effective - models have better knowledge base
✅ COMBINATION of fine-tuning + system prompts = optimal performance

RECOMMENDATION:
  For production deployment of knowledge models:
  • Always use appropriate system prompts
  • Use fine-tuned models for enhanced knowledge
  • Combined dataset models for general-purpose tasks
  • Single-source models for domain-specific tasks
