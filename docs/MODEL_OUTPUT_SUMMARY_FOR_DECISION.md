# Quick Reference: Knowledge Model Outputs Summary

## Purpose
This document summarizes the characteristics of each model's outputs to help you decide:
- Whether to retrain with different data
- OR just optimize the system prompt

## Model Output Characteristics (Based on 20 Samples)

### 3B MODELS

#### Original 3B
- **Style**: Formal, structured, often uses headers/sections
- **Tone**: "As a digital AI assistant..." (very AI-like)
- **Knowledge**: General, accurate but generic
- **Best for**: Structured, formal responses

#### 3B Knowledge (Combined)
- **Style**: Very conversational, natural dialogue
- **Tone**: Casual, engaging, asks follow-up questions
- **Knowledge**: Relevant but conversational, not factual/statistical
- **Best for**: Natural conversations, dialogue systems
- **Example**: "Oh really, was it a no-kill shelter or..."

#### 3B Knowledge (Wikidata)
- **Style**: More factual, encyclopedia-like
- **Tone**: Informative but still conversational
- **Knowledge**: Entity-focused, definitions, relationships
- **Best for**: Quick facts, entity information
- **Example**: "American animator, director, and producer (1911-1961)"

#### 3B Knowledge (Wikipedia)
- **Style**: Detailed explanations with context
- **Tone**: Educational, comprehensive
- **Knowledge**: In-depth with background information
- **Best for**: Detailed explanations, educational content
- **Example**: "William Hanna and Joseph Barbera, the creators of Tom and Jerry, were a dynamic duo..."

#### 3B Knowledge (KILT WOW)
- **Style**: Most conversational, dialogue-style
- **Tone**: Very casual, interactive
- **Knowledge**: Contextual, conversational knowledge
- **Best for**: Chat systems, interactive dialogues
- **Example**: "Their success even led to them being awarded an Oscar..."

### 8B MODELS

#### Original 8B
- **Style**: Very formal, structured with headers/sections
- **Tone**: Professional, comprehensive
- **Knowledge**: Detailed, well-organized
- **Best for**: Professional documentation, formal responses
- **Example**: "**Understanding Singing**\n\nSinging is indeed the act of..."

#### 8B Knowledge (Combined)
- **Style**: Conversational but more informative than 3B
- **Tone**: Balanced between casual and informative
- **Knowledge**: Good depth while staying conversational
- **Best for**: Balanced conversational + informative responses

#### 8B Knowledge (Wikidata)
- **Style**: Factual with good structure
- **Tone**: Informative, encyclopedic
- **Knowledge**: Strong on facts, definitions, statistics
- **Best for**: Factual lookups, entity information
- **Example**: Provides specific statistics and facts

#### 8B Knowledge (Wikipedia)
- **Style**: Most detailed, comprehensive
- **Tone**: Educational, thorough
- **Knowledge**: Deep explanations with context and background
- **Best for**: In-depth educational content, detailed explanations

#### 8B Knowledge (KILT WOW)
- **Style**: Conversational knowledge integration
- **Tone**: Natural dialogue with knowledge
- **Knowledge**: Contextual facts woven into conversation
- **Best for**: Knowledge-grounded conversations

## Key Findings

### What Fine-Tuning Did:
✅ Made models MORE conversational (vs formal/structured)
✅ Added domain-specific knowledge characteristics
✅ Improved natural dialogue flow
✅ Made responses more contextually appropriate

### What Fine-Tuning Did NOT Do:
❌ Did not make models provide statistical facts ("average haircut every 4-6 weeks")
❌ Did not make models less conversational
❌ Did not make models provide structured factual data

## Decision Framework

### Option 1: Optimize System Prompt (Faster)
**When to choose:**
- If you see that one of the fine-tuned models (especially 8B Wikidata or Wikipedia) shows SOME of the behavior you want
- If the outputs are "close enough" and just need better guidance
- If you need results quickly

**Pros:**
- Fast to implement
- No GPU time needed
- Can iterate quickly

**Cons:**
- Limited by what the model learned during training
- System prompts have limits (you saw this already)
- May not get the statistical/factual style you want

### Option 2: Retrain with Different Data (Slower but More Effective)
**When to choose:**
- If NONE of the current models show the statistical/factual style you want
- If you need outputs like "average adults get haircut every 4-6 weeks"
- If you have time for another training cycle

**What would change:**
- Create custom dataset with statistical/factual responses
- Use encyclopedic sources (not conversational dialogues)
- Include examples of the exact style you want

**Pros:**
- Can train the model to respond exactly as you want
- More fundamental change
- Better long-term results

**Cons:**
- Requires creating new dataset
- Another training cycle (~7-8 hours)
- More work upfront

## Recommendation

**Look through the comprehensive report** (`/home/KNOWLEDGE_COMPREHENSIVE_COMPARISON_20_SAMPLES.txt`) and check:

1. **Does ANY model** show glimpses of the factual/statistical style you want?
   - If YES → Try optimizing system prompt with few-shot examples
   - If NO → Consider retraining with different data

2. **How important** is the statistical/factual style for your use case?
   - Critical → Retrain with custom data
   - Nice to have → Try prompt optimization first

3. **Timeline constraints?**
   - Tight → Optimize prompts
   - Flexible → Retrain for better results
