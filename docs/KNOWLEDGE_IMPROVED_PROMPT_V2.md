# Knowledge Model Evaluation - Improved System Prompt (v2)

## Issue

The initial system prompt was too generic and conversational. The models were not providing the type of **informative, factual descriptions** we needed.

### What We Wanted:
For "My hair is very long, I think I need a haircut soon":
- ‚úÖ "Average adults get a haircut every 4-6 weeks on average"
- ‚úÖ Hair growth patterns and statistics
- ‚úÖ Common haircut frequencies

For "Now that I have kids, I'm seeing shows I used to watch...":
- ‚úÖ "Parents raising children tend to watch children's shows together - this is normal"
- ‚úÖ "Present-day parents would have watched Tom and Jerry, Looney Tunes, Mickey Mouse as children"
- ‚úÖ Context about generational viewing patterns

### What We Were Getting:
- ‚ùå Conversational responses
- ‚ùå "I'm a digital assistant..." type answers
- ‚ùå Lack of informative, factual content

## Solution: Improved System Prompt (v2)

### Previous System Prompt (v1):
```
"You are a knowledgeable assistant. Provide informative, factual descriptions 
and explanations to answer questions. Focus on delivering comprehensive 
information rather than just conversational responses."
```

**Problem**: Too vague, not directive enough

### New System Prompt (v2):
```
You are an informative knowledge assistant. When answering questions, provide 
relevant factual information, statistics, context, and background details that 
help the user understand the topic better. Focus on:

1. Relevant facts and statistics
2. Common patterns and behaviors related to the topic
3. Historical context or background information
4. Practical information that adds value

Do NOT simply respond conversationally. Always provide informative, educational content.
```

**Improvements**:
- ‚úÖ Much more directive and specific
- ‚úÖ Clear numbered list of what to focus on
- ‚úÖ Explicit instruction to avoid conversational responses
- ‚úÖ Emphasis on facts, statistics, patterns, and context

## Re-Evaluation In Progress

**Status**: üü° Running  
**Started**: 10:11 KST  
**Models**: 10 (5 √ó 3B + 5 √ó 8B)  
**Samples**: 10 per model  
**Estimated Time**: ~15-20 minutes

**Monitor Progress**:
```bash
tail -f /home/logs/knowledge_improved_prompt_evaluation.log
```

## Expected Results

With this improved, more directive system prompt, we expect:

### ‚úÖ Better Outputs:
- Factual information and statistics
- Context about common patterns and behaviors
- Historical background when relevant
- Practical, useful information

### ‚ùå Fewer:
- Generic conversational responses
- "I'm an AI assistant" type answers
- Responses that don't add informative value

## Files

**Results** (when complete):
- `/home/evaluation_results_knowledge_improved_prompt.json`

**Log**:
- `/home/logs/knowledge_improved_prompt_evaluation.log`

**Scripts**:
- `/home/scripts/evaluation/re_evaluate_knowledge_improved.py`
- `/home/scripts/evaluation/run_knowledge_improved_prompt.sh`

## Next Steps

Once complete:
1. ‚úÖ Review outputs to verify they match desired format
2. ‚úÖ Compare v1 vs v2 system prompts
3. ‚úÖ Update all reports with final findings
4. ‚úÖ Document best practices for production
