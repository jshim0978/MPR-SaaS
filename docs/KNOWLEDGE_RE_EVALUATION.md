# Knowledge Model Re-Evaluation with System Prompts

## Issue Identified

The initial evaluation of knowledge/description generation models showed that while grammar and paraphrase fine-tunings were very effective, the knowledge models were generating more **conversational responses** rather than **informative descriptions**.

## Solution Applied

Added a **system prompt** to guide the knowledge models to generate informative, factual descriptions:

```
"You are a knowledgeable assistant. Provide informative, factual descriptions and 
explanations to answer questions. Focus on delivering comprehensive information 
rather than just conversational responses."
```

## Changes Made

### 1. Updated Evaluation Script (`evaluate_all_16_models.py`)
- Modified `generate_response()` function to accept optional `system_prompt` parameter
- Updated `prepare_knowledge_test()` to include system prompt in each sample
- Updated `evaluate_model_category()` to pass system prompt when present

### 2. Created Re-Evaluation Script
- **Script**: `/home/scripts/evaluation/re_evaluate_knowledge_models.py`
- **Shell Wrapper**: `/home/scripts/evaluation/run_knowledge_re_evaluation.sh`
- **Purpose**: Re-evaluate all 10 knowledge models with improved prompts

## Models Being Re-Evaluated

### 3B Models (5 total):
1. Original Llama 3.2 3B (baseline)
2. 3B Knowledge (Combined: Wikidata + Wikipedia + KILT)
3. 3B Knowledge (Wikidata-only)
4. 3B Knowledge (Wikipedia-only)
5. 3B Knowledge (KILT WOW-only)

### 8B Models (5 total):
6. Original Llama 3.1 8B (baseline)
7. 8B Knowledge (Combined: Wikidata + Wikipedia + KILT)
8. 8B Knowledge (Wikidata-only)
9. 8B Knowledge (Wikipedia-only)
10. 8B Knowledge (KILT WOW-only)

## Expected Improvements

### Before (Without System Prompt):
- Models generated conversational responses
- Less focus on factual information
- More casual/chatty outputs

### After (With System Prompt):
- Models should generate informative descriptions
- Better focus on factual, comprehensive information
- More structured, knowledge-dense outputs

## Files Generated

1. **Results**: `/home/evaluation_results_knowledge_with_system_prompt.json`
   - Complete evaluation data with improved prompts
   - 10 models × 10 samples = 100 generations

2. **Log**: `/home/logs/knowledge_re_evaluation.log`
   - Real-time progress tracking
   - Error messages and completion status

## Status

**Running Now!**

Started: October 29, 2025 at 09:51 KST

Monitor progress:
```bash
tail -f /home/logs/knowledge_re_evaluation.log
```

Estimated time: ~15-20 minutes (10 models × ~2 minutes each)

## Next Steps

Once re-evaluation completes:
1. ✅ Review new knowledge evaluation results
2. ✅ Compare with previous results to verify improvement
3. ✅ Update comprehensive report with new findings
4. ✅ Confirm all 16 models are now showing effective fine-tuning
