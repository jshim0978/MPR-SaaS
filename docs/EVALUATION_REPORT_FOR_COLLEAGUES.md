```

### Model Comparisons

| Model | Output | Analysis |
|-------|--------|----------|
| **Original 3B** | "The corrected sentence is:<br><br>\"New and new technology has been introduced to society.\"<br><br>The error in the original sentence is the double use of \"new\". \"New\" is an adjective..." | ❌ **VERBOSE**<br>• Adds "The corrected sentence is:"<br>• Provides unnecessary explanation<br>• 3x longer than needed<br>• Not suitable for automation |
| **Fine-tuned 3B** | "New technology has been introduced to society." | ✅ **PERFECT**<br>• Direct correction only<br>• Matches reference exactly<br>• No extra text<br>• **Production-ready** |
| **Original 8B** | "The corrected sentence is:<br><br>New technologies have been introduced to society.<br><br>Explanation: The subject..." | ❌ **VERBOSE + OVER-CORRECTS**<br>• Adds explanation<br>• Changes "technology" to "technologies" unnecessarily<br>• Even more verbose than 3B |
| **Fine-tuned 8B** | "Newer and newer technology has been introduced to society." | ✅ **EXCELLENT**<br>• Clean correction<br>• Matches alternative reference<br>• No explanation<br>• **Production-ready** |

## Why Fine-Tuning Worked So Well

### 1. **Training Format Effect**
- **JFLEG format**: `[user: "Fix: <text>"]` → `[assistant: "<corrected>"]`
- **4,810 examples** with 4 corrections each = 19,240 training pairs
- Models learned to output **only the correction**, nothing else
- This pattern was reinforced through thousands of examples

### 2. **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) Advantages**
- **Parameters**: rank=16, alpha=32
- **Modified layers**: Only attention mechanisms
- **Preserved**: General language understanding
- **Learned**: Task-specific behavior (minimal editing, direct output)

### 3. **Minimal Editing Principle**
- Training data showed minimal necessary changes
- Models internalized: "Don't over-correct, preserve original intent"
- Results in cleaner, more predictable output

### 4. **Model Size Effects**
- **3B model**: 
  - Faster inference (~3.8x)
  - Sufficient quality for grammar correction
  - **Ideal for jw2 (Cleaner)** in MPR-Agents
- **8B model**:
  - Slightly more nuanced corrections
  - Good as backup or for complex cases
  - Higher memory footprint
