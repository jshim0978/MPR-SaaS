CRITICAL FINDING
================================================================================

❌ THE COMBINED TRAINING MADE RESPONSES SHORTER, NOT MORE INFORMATIVE

Both 3B and 8B combined models produce SIGNIFICANTLY shorter responses
than their original counterparts:

  • 3B model: -89% reduction in response length
  • 8B model: -90% reduction in response length

The combined models produce brief, dictionary-style definitions rather than
detailed, informative explanations.

RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

❌ Current Situation:
   The Wikipedia + Wikidata training produced models that are TOO CONCISE.
   They give brief definitions rather than informative explanations.

🎯 What You Wanted:
   Detailed, informative, factual descriptions with specific data
   (like 'average adults get haircut every 4-6 weeks')

💡 Options:

1. ⚡ TRY SYSTEM PROMPTS (Quick):
   Use the ORIGINAL models (not combined) with optimized system prompts.
   The original models already produce detailed, informative responses!
   Just need to guide them with proper prompting.

2. 🔄 RETRAIN WITH DIFFERENT DATA (Slower):
   Create a custom dataset with longer, more detailed responses.
   Current training data (Wiki + Wikidata) seems to emphasize brevity.
   Need dataset that demonstrates the detailed style you want.

3. 📝 RETRAIN WITH MODIFIED PROMPTS:
   Use the same data but modify the training format to encourage
   longer, more detailed responses in the training examples.

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATION: START WITH OPTION 1
================================================================================

✅ The original models ALREADY produce the detailed responses you want!
   No need to retrain - just optimize the system prompt to guide them
   toward the specific style you prefer.

   This will be:
   • FAST (minutes vs hours)
   • FREE (no GPU training costs)
   • ITERATIVE (can test many variations quickly)
