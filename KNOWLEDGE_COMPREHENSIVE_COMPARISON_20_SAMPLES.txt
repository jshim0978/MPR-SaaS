ANALYSIS & CONCLUSIONS
================================================================================

🎯 KEY FINDINGS:

1. PROMPT SPECIFICITY MATTERS:
   • More directive prompts lead to better outputs
   • Generic prompts show some improvement but not enough
   • Improved v2 prompt provides clearest guidance

2. DESIRED OUTPUT CHARACTERISTICS:
   ✅ Should provide: Facts, statistics, patterns, context
   ❌ Should avoid: Generic conversational responses

3. FINE-TUNING EFFECTIVENESS:
   • Fine-tuned models have better knowledge base
   • System prompts guide HOW to present that knowledge
   • Best results: Fine-tuning + Improved Prompt

4. PRODUCTION RECOMMENDATIONS:
   ✅ Use improved system prompt (v2) for knowledge tasks
   ✅ Use fine-tuned models for enhanced knowledge
   ✅ Test and iterate on system prompts for your specific use case
